## Contents Engagement 

### Performance

> `App`:
![image](/img/Docs/)


> `Db`: topentry_u

```js
Fetches entries from the db table using params: PageName, PageURL and Date.
```

### Engagement

> `App`:
![image](/img/Docs/)


> `Db`: Contents

```js
Fetches entries from the db table using params: PageName and PageURL.
The days functionality doesn't work since the db has an aggregate data available.
```

### Top Entry Points

> `App`:
![image](/img/Docs/)


> `Db`: topentry_u

```js
Fetches entries from the db table using params: PageName, PageURL and Date.
```


### Visitor Engagement
> `App`:
![image](/img/Docs/)


> `Db`: clickmap

```js
Fetches 500 entries from the db table using params: PageName and PageURL.

click map currently has static values and needed 3 test cases to figure out the right scenario.


var point = {
x = 'x coordinate', ( replace with x value)
y='y coordinate', ( replace with y value)
value = 'val'   }
a) First test case is to map 5 static data points without value field 
ex coordinates: { (1,2), (3,4),(7,2),(8,1),(6,2)}
b) Second test case is to map 10 static data points with recurring data points and no value field
ex coordinates: {(1,2), (3,4),(7,2),(8,1),(6,2),(1,4),(4,8),(3,6),(3,6),(3,6)}
c) Third case is to map the same points as b and have an incrementing value for every recurring value for value field
ex coordinates: {(1,2), (3,4),(7,2),(8,1),(6,2),(1,4),(4,8),(3,6),(3,6),(3,6)}
value field for (3,6) would be 3
"Please use random data points for mapping instead of the example coordinates"
